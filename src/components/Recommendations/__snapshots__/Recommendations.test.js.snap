            I worked with Manikanta for almost two years 
      and he shown himself to be a capable and productive developer. 
      He's a quick learner, inquisitive and resourceful. 
      He can start a new package and get it live, he can independently develop a new infrastructure tool, 
      and is always on the lookout for new challenges.

            I have worked with Manikanta, for several different projects ranging 
        from windows mobile apps to android to angular and node.js. 
        He is an excellent problem solver, he has no fear for diving into the code bases written by others, 
        regardless of complexity. Hacker by nature, he quickly gives you the prototype of your app 
        and iterate over it by taking the feedback. He has a good visual sense like a designer, 
        and he also know sketch, posts random things in behance and things like that.
         He has passion to complete the product with in the stipulated time, with the best of the quality code and UI. 
         I look forward to work with him for the multiple projects in the days to come.
